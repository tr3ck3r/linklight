# Exercise 6 - Tower API

Ansible Tower has a RESTFUL API, which we'll explore a little here.

There are 2 versions, v2 being the current one.

## First API Call:

To see the kind of things you can call, try hitting https://public_IP/api/v2/

## Calling the API to check status:

Calling the API ping can be a useful 'health' check. https://public_IP/api/v2/ping/

## End Result
We've explored the Tower API briefly.
