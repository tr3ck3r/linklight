# Ansible Linklight

![linklight](images/linklight.png)


This content is a multi-purpose toolkit for effectively demonstrating Ansible's capabilities on Cisco network equipment or providing informal workshop training in various forms -- instructor-led, hands-on or self-paced.  The exercises have been modified from the original to work in GNS3 and for author preference.
